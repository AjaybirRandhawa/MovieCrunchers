# MovieCrunchers
Final project done in collaboration with 3 others.

## Goal
Welcome to the newly created MovieCrunchers, the worldâ€™s preeminent destination for movie criticism, commentary and community.
        MovieCrunchers is currently one of the latest movie reviewing sites that are available on the internet. Since most of the 
        internet users around the world are using online services to watch movies online, we inspired ourselves to make a place
        that allows you to review the latest movies you've watched. If you have ever felt the need for reviewing movies and TV series, 
        here your search comes to an end. As an up and coming website, we're constantly looking forward to working with our userbase and
        helping our users feel more welcomed.
